5. Simple Banking Application
Creating a basic banking application is a great way to practice your Java skills, as having some grasp of the language 
will be needed to complete the project.

This project will introduce you to many basic Java concepts like printing, variables, if/else statements, strings, 
loops, and more. Youâ€™ll create an application that allows a user to check a bank balance, deposit money, withdraw money, 
and exit the interface. Check out this ATM/simple banking app to help you work through this project.
